Good night.
Until next time.
Work time is over.
Time to retire for the day.
Have a nice evening.
Work shift is over.
We'll be retiring now.
Time has flown and it's time to rest.
Have you remembered to strech?
Don't forget to shut everything down.
And one more in the bag.
One more down, a few thousand to go.
What do you have in mind for this night?
We're done for today.
How was your day today?
